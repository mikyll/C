Upgrades:

-dinamically created array for 'participants' and 'secretSanta';
-make the function 'invalidSantaCheck', used in the 2nd algorithm return an array of index (using a struct(?)), so it doesn't have to cycle again by zero everytime;
-test the efficiency

add algorithm:
1) shuffle the array;
2) everyone must give to the next one
